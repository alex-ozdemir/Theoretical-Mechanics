\begin{problem}[i]
Energy loss in a damped-driven oscillator. The problem set is light this week so that you have more time to prepare for and take the midterm.

\begin{problem}
Consider a damped oscillator, with natural frequency $\omega_0$ and damping constant $\beta$ both fixed, that is driven by a force $F(t) = F_0 \cos (\omega t)$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Find the rate of $P(t)$ at which $F(t)$ does work and show that the average rate $\langle P \rangle$ over any number of complete cycles is $m \beta \omega^2 A^2$.

\item Verify that this is the same as the average rate at which energy is lost to the resistive force.

\item Show that as $\omega$ is varied $\langle P \rangle$ is maximum when $\omega = \omega_0$; that is, the resonance of the power occurs at $\omega = \omega_0$ (exactly).

\end{enumerate}
